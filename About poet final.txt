    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Padma Gopal is her first poetry collection. she grew up in a village in a solePatil house where The nature was quiet and timid. she was the only girl in sixth and seventh class. Later, she studied in Ahemadnagar . she studied there only till eleventh standard. He somehow completed his further education by staying in the village and coming to the city only for exams. Famous poetess Vandana Vitankar used to live opposite to Nirmalas house in nagar. she used to listen to his songs on the radio. she had douts and she used to ask herself the question that will she be able to write? Poet Mr. Ramdas Phutane used to come to her father. Due to all this, the mind was more inclined towards the subjects of poetry. He is also very fond of reading. She learned that Rajni Bhalerao who was form her village also wrote poetry. she used to Bring her notebook and read it, she became more enthusiastic and started writing poems vigorously. It must have been 1977. she was twenty years when she wrote her frist poem .At first she did not like her poems cause It didn't go that well. So she didn't show it to anyone. After marriage, she did not write anything for almost twenty years. Later, when herchildren grew up, she found time and automatically turned to poetry as a hobby. Writing poetry requires time and solitude and must be suggested from the heart. Occasionally she did not get time to writes poems. There was no time to write, but she would stop work and take time to write, so that the lines her mind would not escape. she used to a paper and pen somewhere nearby. Most of the time, the paper was kept on the fridge, under the mattress or in the purse. Later, when he had free time, she would write poems on paper in a notebook. Thus these poems were written and preserved. While at Jamkhed, she read all kinds of books and texts from the library. That made the thoughts deeper . later she shifted to pune but she didnt give up on her hoby she continued writing and this is how she managed to write over a 1000 poems.
